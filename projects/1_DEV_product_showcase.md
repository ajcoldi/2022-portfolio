## Project Goals

This portfolio project showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Babylon.js. The focal point of this project is a visually appealing GUI featuring a Babylon.js 3D viewport. The interactive 3D viewport allows users to click on various iPod models, triggering the rendering of the selected model in the canvas.

One of the key objectives of this project was to establish a modular and class-based project structure, laying the foundation for a scalable template that could potentially evolve into a basic framework in the future. To achieve this, I leveraged webpack as a bundler, streamlining the development and deployment process.

In addition, I utilized Blender, a popular 3D modeling software, to create simplistic 3D models that enhance the visual experience of the project. The overall design of the portfolio project is inspired by an older portfolio design I previously developed. It combines 3D and 2D web design elements, demonstrating my ability to harmonize both mediums without overemphasizing one over the other.

By building this project, I aimed to showcase my technical skills in web development, particularly in the realm of 3D graphics and user interaction.
